## 🤖 AI Development Statement

**This project is a highly experimental AI-driven development case:**
**99%** of this mod's content was generated by Artificial Intelligence, including code implementation, textures, numerical design, and documentation.

- **Core Architecture & Logic:** Powered by **Gemini 1.5 Pro** and **Gemini 2.0 Flash**.
- **Assisted Debugging:** Logic optimization collaborated with **DeepSeek**.

### ⚠️ Maintenance & Contribution Guide
As this project is deeply dependent on AI, the developer does not possess the ability to perform large-scale code refactoring or low-level debugging without AI assistance.
- **Maintenance Mode:** All fixes and feature updates must be completed through AI collaboration.
- **Project Lifecycle:** This mod is the core driver for the **Simple Skyblock Chronicle** modpack. I will only provide limited maintenance support during the development of that modpack. Once the modpack is stable, this project will **cease further maintenance**.
- **Contribution Suggestions:** If you wish to improve this mod or perform long-term extensions, **it is strongly recommended that you Fork this repository** for independent development.

## 🧩 Mod Introduction

**SSC Core** is a utility and framework mod designed for the **Simple Skyblock Chronicle** modpack, introducing several unique machines.

### Key Features
*   **🛠️ Deconstruction Table:**
    *   **Reverse Engineering:** Capable of breaking down items into their original crafting materials.
    *   **Dual Logic:**
        *   **Manual Definition:** Allows precise specification of deconstruction outputs via config or scripts.
        *   **Automatic Derivation:** Supports direct referencing of existing recipes (by ID or output item filter) to dynamically extract ingredients as results.
    *   **Industrial Properties:** Supports custom processing time, energy consumption (FE), and multi-tier machine configurations.
*   **🔌 KubeJS Deep Integration:**
    *   Modpack authors can use simple JS syntax to define complex deconstruction logic.
    *   Supports `deconstruction` and `from_recipe` native APIs, perfectly aligned with the backend Record structure.

## 🛠️ Requirements
*   **Minecraft:** 1.21.1
*   **NeoForge:** 21.1.x or higher
*   **Dependencies:** 
    *   [KubeJS](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/kubejs-neoforge) (Highly recommended for custom recipes)
